# key 
unique key property shoud have unique key property key is reserve id we passes reserve id
why is key is used in react ?
becuase react does not know identify element which one rendering component if u not key entire rc card rendering so that used key they used identify which one updated

React index as key as bad pracise we dont recommednded using indexes for key of order of item may changes this negative impact performance and many cause issues which component state 

use option chaning 
data?name

//not using keys (not acceptable)<<index as key <<< unique best pracuse
